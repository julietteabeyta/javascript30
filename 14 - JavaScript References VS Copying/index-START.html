    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // //this will be 100, 100
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // //this will be 200, 100
    // console.log(age, age2);
    //values of all of these things do not change if set
    //prior to variable reassignment

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    //players is the original array and team is just a 
    //reference to it so when you update the team, it
    //updates players
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread (takes every item out of the iterable and 
    //put it into an array)
    const team4 = [...players];

    //or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //this is actually just a reference, similar to team = players;
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //start with an empty object, then the object you want to copy,
    //then the value you want to change
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12});
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //similar to spreading into an array but we are spreading
    //into an object-- this is not in js yet!
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const juliette = {
      name: 'Juliette Spencer',
      age: 666,
      social: {
        twitter: '@julietteabeyta'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, juliette);
    //if you update dev, it will not affect juliette, however,
    //you can only edit it one layer deep. so you can change dev.name
    //without affecting juliette (the original object), but you can't
    //change dev.social.twitter without changing it in juliette, too

    //the cheaty way-- editing this will not edit juliette
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(juliette));
